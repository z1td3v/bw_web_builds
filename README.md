## Building the web-vault

To build the web-vault you need either node and npm installed or use Docker.

### Using node and npm

For a quick and easy local build you could run:
```bash
make full
```

That will generate a `tar.gz` file within the `builds` directory which you can extract and use with the `WEB_VAULT_FOLDER` environment variable.

### Using a container

Or via the usage of building via a container:
```bash
make container-extract
```

That will extract the `tar.gz` and files generated via Docker into the `container_builds` directory.

#### Which container command to use, docker or podman

The default is to use `docker`, but `podman` works too.

You can force them by replacing `container` with either `docker` or `podman`, like:
```bash
make docker-extract
# Or
make podman-extract
```

You can configure the default via a `.env` file. See the `.env.template`.<br>
Or you can set it as a make argument with the make command:
```bash
make CONTAINER_CMD=podman container-extract
```

### More information

For more information see: [Install the web-vault](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Building-binary#install-the-web-vault)
